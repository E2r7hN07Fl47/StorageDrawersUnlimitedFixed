# StorageDrawersUnlimited

A mod which adds many more Storage Drawers to the game using wood from other mods.

The tools/makeresources.bat script is what I have used to auto-generate
all models, textures, lang entries, and blockstates needed for the drawers from as little
as a single base texture.
tools/ResourceCreator is the actual program used to do this; it has many command-line options
which alter what the program does or what it needs.
